_This is the Bakiwi assembly manual. Following these steps will enable you to build your Bakiwi walking robot from the assembly kit. We encourage everybody to contribute to this project. Please share your ideas, upgrades, schematics, source-code and tricks._


== Tool and Part List
NOTE: Before starting the assembly. Check that you have all the tools and parts in place. We recommend to read this manual once before starting the assembly.

=== Recommended Tools

You will need these tools to assemble the Gretchen (Dev0) robot.

* Small Phillips screw driver
* Soldering iron with a very fine tip for motor assembly, up to 400°C (regulated) temperature
* Tweezers
* Flat-nosed pliers
* Side-cutting pliers
* Wire stripper
* Utility knife
* Multimeter
* Sandpaper or files
* Superglue (optional)
* Hot glue (optional)
* A box of trash for forming legs and bodyparts of your robot.

=== Prepare Workbench and Tools

Wipe your workbench and get all the tools needed as denoted in the list or shown on the picture.

=== Check the Parts

Check the parts in your Bakiwi package for completeness and complain if not complete :)

== Soldering

=== Prepare Soldering
Prepare your workbench for soldering. Use enough light. Make sure there is fresh air during soldering and not breath-in the solder vapor.

Use a fine tip and solder.

image::use_fine_solder_tip.jpg[]

Adjust the soldering station for sufficient heat depending on the solder you use.

image::solder_with_enough_temperature.jpg[]

Keep you parts together as they are tiny and easily get lost whend dropping from the table.

=== Solder Nano Module Header
Insert header pins for the Arduino Nano (compatible) module.

image::insert_pinheader.jpg[]

Use a bread board if available for stabilizing the pins and keep them aligned and perpendicular during soldering.

image::use_breadboard_if_available.jpg[]

Solder the pins one after another.

image::solder_nano_pins.jpg[]

The result should look like this.

=== Resistors
Get the two 1 Kilo Ohms resistors and the SO(2)-Walker daughter board.

Bend the resistors and short the leads.

Insert resistors as depecited and printed on the board's silk screen.

Short the leads after soldering.

=== Capacitors
image::parts_capacitors.jpg[]
image::insert_ceramic_cap.jpg[]

The electrolytic capacitor has a polarity. The short lead is minus, the long wire plus. Make sure polarity is correct as denoted on the board and shown in the picture.

=== LEDs
Get the LEDs, colors can change depending on the version of the assembly kit.

image::parts_leds.jpg[]

The LEDs also have polarity. Again, the short lead is minus, the long wire is plus. Make sure polarity is correct as denoted on the board and shown in the picture. To remember there is a rule of thumb: The dashes of plus sign put together in a line is longer than the minus dash.

=== Switches
Insert slide switch and button
