== Preparation

NOTE: Before starting the assembly. Check that you have all the tools and parts in place. We recommend reading this manual once before starting the assembly.

== Soldering

=== Prepare Soldering
****
Prepare your workbench for soldering. Use a fine tip and thin solder.
****

IMPORTANT: Watch your health! Use enough light. Make sure there is fresh air during soldering and not to breath-in the solder vapor.

CAUTION: Soldering irons get REALLY hot. You need to stay focussed and should be careful not to burn yourself or others. When leaving the room, switch off the soldering station.


image::use_fine_solder_tip.jpg[]

****
Adjust the soldering station for sufficient heat depending on the solder you use. Some stations show the current temperature, make sure to let the iron pre-heat before starting. If soldering 'feels' very sticky, you might have not enough temperature or the flux in the solder is not sufficient. Also, ensure to always use a clean tip, preferably using a dry cleaner.
****

image::solder_with_enough_temperature.jpg[]

****
Keep the electronic parts together as they are tiny and easily get lost when they accidentally drop down from the table.
****

=== Solder Nano Module Header
****
So now you should be prepared for soldering the first part. Insert header pins for the Arduino Nano (compatible) module as shown in the picture.
****

image::insert_pinheader.jpg[]

****
You can use a breadboard, if available, for stabilizing the pin headers and keep them aligned and perpendicular during soldering.
****

image::use_breadboard_if_available.jpg[]

****
Solder the pins one after another. After soldering the first pin, double-check for alignment and correct if needed. Otherwise, continue soldering all 30 pins.
****

image::solder_nano_pins.jpg[]

****
The result should look like this. Sufficient solder looks shiny and volcano-shaped. If it looks like a drop or ball then there is too much solder. You can remove it by cleaning the tip and put the iron again to the pin.

Alternatively, use desoldering braid to remove excessive solder.
****


image::nano_solder_result.jpg[]

=== Resistors
****
Get the two 1 Kilo-Ohms resistors and the SO(2)-Walker daughter board. Don't get irritated as the color might be different than shown in the picture.
****

image::parts_resistor.jpg[]
image::parts_so2walker.jpg[]

****
Bend the resistors very close to the ends and trim the leads as shown in the picture.
****

image::bend_cut_resistor.jpg[]

****
Insert resistors as depecited and printed as R1 and R2 on the board's silk screen. Make sure that the capacitor is soldered very close to the board.
****

image::insert_resistor.jpg[]

****
Trim the leads after soldering using the side-cutting pliers.
****

image::solder_resistors_and_cut_wire.jpg[]

=== Capacitors

****
Get the capacitors. The completely differ in size and form.
****

image::parts_capacitors.jpg[]

****
Insert the ceramic capacitor first as it has a lower profile. Again, make sure that the capacitor is soldered very close to the board.
****

image::insert_ceramic_cap.jpg[]

****
The electrolytic capacitor has a polarity and its leads must not be mixed up. The shorter lead is minus, the longer lead is plus. Make sure polarity is correct as denoted on the board and shown in the picture. The capacitor must be laid on its side since the nano board will be mounted above it.
****

image::insert_electrolytic_cap.jpg[]

=== LEDs
****
Get the LEDs, colors can change depending on the version of the assembly kit.
****

image::parts_leds.jpg[]

****
The LEDs also have polarity. Again, the shorter lead is minus, the long lead is plus. Make sure polarity is correct as denoted on the board and shown in the picture.
****

NOTE: To remember which lead is plus or minus, Imagine, there is a rule of thumb: The dashes of the plus sign put together in a line is longer than the minus dash.

image::insert_leds.jpg[]

=== Switches

****
Get the switches. The left one is a tactile switch, a button so to say. The other one is a slide switch.
****

image::parts_switches.jpg[]

****
Insert and solder the slide switch and button. When inserting the tactile button, look out for correct orientation. There is only one correct way and you probably need to gently press the part into the board. You feel a little click when inserted correctly.
****

image::insert_slide_switch.jpg[]


=== Socket
****
The next thing to solder is the sockets for the nano board. The sockets in your package might have more than 15 slots, so need to trim the socket to exactly 15 slots and use sanding paper to make it even.
****

image::cut_socket.jpg[]
image::sand_socket_cut.jpg[]

****
Then insert the socket and solder the 30 pins. For each half of the socker, make sure the sockets are aligned perpendicular and closest to the board. Otherwise, the nano module might not fit into the socket.
****

image::insert_sockets.jpg[]

== Get a break

NOTE: Grab a coffee, relax your eyes. Get some fruit and fresh air.

image::make_a_break.jpg[]

== Soldering (continue)

****
Hope you are relaxed :)
****

=== Servo Header

****
Get the servo pin headers and insert four times the 1x3 pin servo header to all four corners of the board, next to the screw holes.
Again, make sure the pins are perfectly perpendicular to the board, otherwise, the servo connectors might interfere with the sockets of the nano board.
****

image::insert_servo_pin_header.jpg[]


=== Potentiometers
****
Get the four potentiometers (10KOhms) and the associated knobs (might have a different color) and insert the knobs in such a way that the shiny metal part of the potentiometer is on the back.
****

image::prepare_potis.jpg[]

****
Insert the potentiometers as shown in the picture, turn the board and solder them.
****

image::insert_potis.jpg[]


=== Battery Pack

****
Get the wires (approx. 10cm each). The might have different colors than depicted.
****

image::get_wires.jpg[]

****
Strip the insulation of both of the wires' ends, approx. 3-5 mm, twist the ends a little and pre-solder the wires. Pre-soldering is useful to better insert the wire into solder holes.
****

image::strip_wire_and_presolder.jpg[]

****
The result could look like this.
****

image::wires_result.jpg[]

****
Insert the wires in the prescribed order and solder them to the board. The cable color should at least follow the convention for ground (black), voltage supply (red).
****

image::wire_order.jpg[]

****
Twist pairs of wires, each pair will be associated with a single battery pack of two cells.
****

image::twist_wire.jpg[]

****
Turn the leads of the battery pack a little upwards so they do not stick out over the part.
****

image::battery_pack_turn_leads_upwards.jpg[]

****
Check polarity of the battery pack. It is denoted inside the packs.
****

image::polarity_batterypack.jpg[]

****
Solder wires to the battery packs as shown.
****

CAUTION: Battery packs are made of temperature-sensitive plastic. Try to solder only as short as possible in order to avoid melting the plastic. This could irreversibly damage the pack and lead to connection problems later.

=== Soldering finishing

****
So, congratulations. You did it. You finished soldering. Yay. \o/

Next thing to do is to trim the pins to be as short as 1-1.5 mm.
****

image::cut_pins_short.jpg[]

****
Dispose the trash material correctly. Metal, plastic and paper parts can be recycled and should not be put to residual waste.
****

image::dispose_solder_waste.jpg[]

NOTE: Do not dump the bags. Re-use them or return them to your workshop leader if you do not need them anymore. Save resources.
