_This is the Bakiwi assembly manual. Following these steps will enable you to build your Bakiwi walking robot from the assembly kit. We encourage everybody to contribute to this project. Please share your ideas, upgrades, schematics, source-code and tricks._


== Tool and Part List
NOTE: Before starting the assembly. Check that you have all the tools and parts in place. We recommend to read this manual once before starting the assembly.

=== Recommended Tools

You will need these tools to assemble the Gretchen (Dev0) robot.
